# Book Buddies

## Description

Our application allows an avid reader to search for and save a list of their favorite books.  We used a Google Books API search engine to generate the list of books that a reader can view and save by using their account credentials.  This application was made using MERN: a combination of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js; where React was used to build the front end of the application, MongoDB was used as a database, and Node.js as well as Express.js were a part of the server.  We also refactored the application to be a GraphQL API built with an Apollo Server.  Basically, our application is like an IMDB for books.  It allows readers to comment on their favorite books and share them with their friends.
